##Given Graph : https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Bellman-Ford-Algorithm-1.png

to do: find the mst using prims,kruskals and djikstra's algorithm.

prims: Prim’s Algorithm is an approach to determine minimum cost spanning tree. In this case, we start with single edge of graph and we add edges to it and finally we          get minimum cost tree. In this case, as well, we have n-1 edges when number of nodes in graph are n.

kruskals: It is an algorithm for finding the minimum cost spanning tree of the given graph. In kruskal’s algorithm, edges are added to the spanning tree in increasing             order of cost. If the edge E forms a cycle in the spanning, it is discarded.

djikstra's: Dijkstra algorithm is also called single source shortest path algorithm. It is based on greedy technique. The algorithm maintains a list visited[ ] of                   vertices, whose shortest distance from the source is already known.
